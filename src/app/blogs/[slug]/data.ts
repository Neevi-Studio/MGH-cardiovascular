But here's the good news: tooth decay is largely preventable with the right care and habits. Understanding what causes tooth decay and how to prevent it is key to maintaining a healthy smile.`,
    content2: `Tooth decay occurs when bacteria in your mouth convert sugars from food into acids. These acids erode the enamel, the hard outer layer of your teeth, causing decay over time. To prevent this, you need to limit sugar intake, maintain a strong oral hygiene routine, and visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups.`,
